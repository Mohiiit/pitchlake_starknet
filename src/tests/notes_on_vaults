# unallocated atm_unallocated_pool -> at-the-money vault - 1 mln ETH
# A deployed 500k ETH -> receives 500k ATM_VLT tokens
# B deployed 500k ETH -> receives 500k ATM_VLT tokens
# withdraw / deposit - no limitations

# snapshot moment -> move unallocated pool (entirety) to allocation for next month
# result: unallocated_pool: 0, oct_23_atm_collateral_pool: 1 mln ETH

# ^^^^^^^ what happens here is that all your ETH are moved to collateral pool (oct_23_atm_collateral_pool)

# then you immediately start auction
# for each 1 ATM_VLT holders receive 1 OCT_23_ATM token 
# deposits / withdrawals (from the unallocated pool) are never stopped!

# -------------

# auction starts and CL is 80 gwei per option, payout is 1 ETH per GWei (strike 20, cl 100)
# so 12500 options are placed in the auction
# now say 10000 options sell at a premium of 3$ each

# two solutions:
# first come first served (but then you would need to track the time of deployments) <- NO
# the other solution is:
# each of OCT_23_ATM_AUCTION is converted into 0.8 of OCT_23_ATM and 0.2 of VLT_ATM
# result:
# A: 400k of OCT_23_ATM and 100k of VLT_ATM + 10000 * 3 of USDT
# B: 400k of OCT_23_ATM and 100k of VLT_ATM
