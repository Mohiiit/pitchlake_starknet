// @note Need to manually initialize round 1, either 
// upon vault deployment (constructor) or through a one-time round 1 initializer entry point
// @note Add test that all rounds, r > 1 are initialized automatically once 
// the round (r-1) settles
// @note Test option round params are logical (auction start time < auction end time < option settlement time)
